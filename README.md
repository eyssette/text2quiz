# Text2quiz

Tex2quiz is a quiz app, built with [Svelte Kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/), that can automatically create a (complex) quiz from a simple text.

13 question types are available (True/False, MCQ, Cloze test, Flashcards, Short answers, Drag and drop, Ordering â€¦).

It's only in French for the moment. Sorry.

I'm not a professional developer, so feel free to fix my errors!

## Developing

Install

```bash
npm install

```

You need to create a .env file with :

```
VITE_CRYPTED_MODE_KEY = "YOUR_KEY"
```


Start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```
